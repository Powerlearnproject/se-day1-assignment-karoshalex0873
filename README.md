# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engneering is the  a systematic approac of developing  and maintenace high-starndars softwares
importance:It enables creation of software aplications and systems that  impoves varous aspects of morden life

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of progamming languages:- some languages like javascript ware developed to perfome some task that other languge could not to enhnace high product softwares.

Establishment of  software Engineering as a displaine.

rise of agile methodoligies 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Requirements:- Gathering and documenting user need(requiremnts) and also the system requiremnts
2.Desing: Creating user interface and high-level and destailed software arcthitec
Implementation:_ Invovles actual development (coding) in respect to specification
3 Testing:- Ensure software works Propery
4 Deployment:- Publish the system to  users
5 Maitenace:- Provide sofforts and update to software or system to esnure work to accordance

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is best for projects with fixed requirements and clear timelines, while Agile excels in dynamic environments needing flexibility and iterative improvement

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Deveolper:- Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provides comprehensive toll for writting, Debuging, and tesing code.
Version Control systems(VSC):tolls for tracking changes to source code and coordinating woek among team members

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requiments as  duing the deveoplement cycle
Tight Deadlines hence the are Rushed
Techincal Debt
some of startegies are:
(i)effective communication
(ii)Agile methodologies
(iii) Prioritizing of tasks
iv) regular reaaccesment of projects goasl and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing
What: Tests individual components or functions.
Purpose: Validate that each unit works as expected.
Tools: JUnit, Jest.

Integration Testing
What: Tests interactions between integrated components.
Purpose: Ensure components work together correctly.
Tools: TestNG, Cypress.

System Testing
What: Tests the entire system as a whole.
Purpose: Validate overall system behavior and functionality.
Tools: Selenium, QTP.

Acceptance Testing
What: Tests the system against requirements.
Purpose: Verify if the system meets business needs.
Tools: Cucumber, FitNesse.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models
Prompt engineering helps avoid confusing answer by making your questions clear and specific

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Tell me about machine learning

impoved vesrion
what is machine learing and varous type of machine leaning and example in each case
